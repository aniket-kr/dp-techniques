# Dynamic Programming Techniques <!-- omit in toc -->
DP Techniques is a repo that houses all the code that was authored
by me when I was learning the dynamic programming techniques. The code
structure and content is heavily inspired by the
[Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go)
YouTube series by **Aditya Verma**.
